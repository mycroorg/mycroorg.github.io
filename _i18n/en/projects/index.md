We are currently working on several [research lines](#research-lines) united by a common factor: the importance of mycotoxins for food safety.

In parallel, we carry out numerous [science communication](#science-communication) activities for the general audience, both of our work and of other aspects of Microbiology. Some of the projects are born directly in our group, while others are collaborative projects in which we contribute actively.
